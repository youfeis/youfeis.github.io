This year is going to be the beginning of hell if I cannot start doing something. I might have been fell in some kind of vicious circle. Whenever I try to start with something, the side effect of my last job/project/assignment crushes on me.
I must be too lazy to do anything. The whole reading break is totally spoiled. I wish I could have done something good for my school work, but I didn't.
