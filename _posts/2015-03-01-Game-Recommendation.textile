I will give this game a 10/10 evaluation. The Binding of Isaac provides the best game experience it can in a 2D game. The gaming mechanism is simple and ideal.
Simply shoot projectiles to hit enemies and avoid the projectiles from enemies. The best part is to collect. There are over 400 items to be collected and they all have unique effects.
Beside items, the main storyline is like a puzzle, players collect the clue to guess what happened to Isaac and his mother by completing the game in various ways.
Just buy this game, it's on steam.
