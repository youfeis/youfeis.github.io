I have been using Coursera for a few months. It provides various online courses to public with decent qualities. I'd say, wayyyy better than SFU remote education courses.
I strongly recommend the Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 and part 2 held by Stanford University if you want to have good understanding in algorithms. The required SFU courses are not sufficient if you want to be a decent coder.
Going through these 2 courses will definitely help you with the fundamental in computing science.
