Finally I can put that project to an end. People from the museum has reviewed this application and gives only a few points to alter. 
I find that quoting the amount of work is critically important. For this project I quoted only 40 hours. But actually, it cost me like over 80 hours - twice the hours I quoted.
I wish I had never take this job.
