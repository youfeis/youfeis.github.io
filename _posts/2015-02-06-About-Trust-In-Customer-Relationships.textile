Two weeks ago, someone came up to me and asked that if I can help him out with his forum software. The forum was used for an on-line game that we are both playing.
It had a basic requirement which was to automatically assign a user to a specific group according to the user's in-game API key. This forum was basic. However, the person asked me about this forum refused my offer of building the site for him.
He only wanted me to teach him how he should do everything, step by step. He was in lack of English and basic computer skills. Which means that was nearly impossible.
After a few days, finally, he was realized that he had to let someone do it. But this time, he was stuck into a commercial forum software. No matter how detailed I explained the case, he was not getting persuaded.
After a whole night struggling this, he decided to give that up. It was only because that another person is telling him that commercial forum software was not useful.
Sadly I cannot keep this cooperation like that. I regret wasting hours like that without basic trust in a voluntary job.
