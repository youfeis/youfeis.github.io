Recently, I have been spending countless hours on a project, which is to convert a macromedia flash movie clip into an interactive HTML5 website. Even if the Greensock plug-in has been already ported from Flash to HTML5, moving many small parts of element around is not really what HTML5 good at.
Considering creating an automatic script to generate the target code may take even longer time, I had to use brute force to position those small pieces one by one. What an awful task. 
Finally, I can say goodbye to this project very soon. Keep my finger crossed - there is no bug left in it.
