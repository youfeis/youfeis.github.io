It has been so long since the last time I went to Whistler. Finally I got the time and passion going to snowboard. 
Well, besides I still have a project way behind the progress, my girlfriend was complaining about this trip, too.
We finally made our settlement, but I need to find something make her up next week. She will get mad if I cannot spend more time with her.
Hopefully life will be easier and I will not have that much of work then.
