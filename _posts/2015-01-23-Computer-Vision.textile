The computing vision is something really hard to deal with. The work is essentially difficult in 2D cases. To distinguish objects in million of pixel values, a lot of math tools need to be used.
This simplest work to find out cigarette butts is even a great challenge. The edge detection is not working the trivial way we prefer. We have to somehow alter the image to get perfect edges.
Then next step we can have the corners detected to be the signature for the cigarette butts. 
Hopefully I can at least find out some butts in the easiest cases.
